# Circle — Frontend (Demo)

This folder contains a simple React + Vite frontend demo for Circle, a friendship maintenance app.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

The UI is intentionally minimal — it demonstrates friend cards, last-contact tracking, and actions like "Remind me" and "Message". The backend is not yet implemented; the UI uses mock data.

Files:
- `src/` — React source files
- `index.html` — Vite entry
- `package.json` — scripts and deps
