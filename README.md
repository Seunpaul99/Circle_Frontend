Circle is a simple app that helps you stay connected with the important people in your life. It reminds you when you haven’t reached out to friends in a while and makes it easy to check in, send a message, or set reminders — so friendships don’t fade over time.

This folder contains a simple React + Vite frontend demo for Circle, a friendship maintenance app.

**✨ What the Product Does (Plain, Descriptive Terms)**

Circle keeps track of how long it’s been since you last spoke to a friend. It then helps you stay in touch by:

- Showing your friends in a simple card layout
- Highlighting who you’ve not contacted recently
- Giving quick actions like “Message” or “Remind Me Later”
- Helping you build healthier, more consistent communication habits

_In short: Circle makes it easier to maintain friendships in a busy world._

**💛 Why It Matters (More Depth)**
Life gets busy, and even important relationships can fade when we forget to check in. Circle solves this problem by making friendship maintenance intentional and easy.

_It helps users:_
- Strengthen real-life connections
- Avoid losing touch with important people
- Build healthier social habits
- Feel more emotionally supported

**_Circle isn’t another social network — it’s a tool for relationship wellness.
**_

Many people lose touch with friends—not because they don’t care, but because life gets busy. Circle solves this by giving gentle reminders and an easy way to reach out.

It matters because it:
- Reduces unintentional friend drift
- Strengthens relationships through consistent check-ins
- Supports emotional well-being by keeping people socially connected
- Helps users maintain meaningful bonds without stress or forgetfulness

People don’t need another complex social app — they need a simple tool that helps them stay close to the people who matter.

_**This structure allows users to:**_

- Start quick from the Home screen.
- Navigate deeply into any feature via the bottom bar.
- Flow naturally between related features (e.g., from a Circle to planning a Vacation).
- Receive proactive nudges via the Connect screen that drive engagement with the app's core purpose.

🗂 What’s Inside This Frontend Folder

This folder contains the frontend demo built with React + Vite.

Quick start:

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`

The UI is intentionally minimal — it demonstrates friend cards, last-contact tracking, and actions like "Remind me" and "Message". The backend is not yet implemented; the UI uses mock data.

Files:
- `src/` — React source files
- `index.html` — Vite entry
- `package.json` — scripts and deps
